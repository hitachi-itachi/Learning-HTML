  <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species
    such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term
    for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
    adult female bird ish called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans now keep chickens
    primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>
  <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of
    2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are
    numerous cultural references to chickens â€“ in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.[citation
